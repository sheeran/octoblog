Another [Moleskin][1] book for 2013.

{% img http://www.nealsheeran.com/images/moleskin2.jpg My trusty Moleskin notebook %}

Infinite battery.  No cloud sync issues, unless I forget to take it with me. You want a future-proof data format? Pen on paper beats plain text any day. I like [Fantastical][2] and [OmniFocus][3] as much as the next productivity dork, but stuff I need either starts or ends in one of these. 

I will admit that the search algorithm can be a bit, shall we say, inefficient.
