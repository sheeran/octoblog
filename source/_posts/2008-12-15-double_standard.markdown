Lemme get this [straight][1]: Caroline Kennedy, who hasn't been elected so much as dogcatcher of anywhere, wants to be _appointed_ to the soon-to-be-open Senate seat from New York? And her lack of qualifications have ruffled enough feathers that she has hired a political consultant to do some "convincing" for her? 

Any day now, the liberal masses that just recently recovered from their convulsions at the thought of a certain _elected_ Governor of Alaska being elected Vice President will no doubt completely lose their minds at this travesty. 

I won't hold my breath.
