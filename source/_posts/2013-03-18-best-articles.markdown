Great compendium of articles. Includes three by David Foster Wallace, and two from Michael Lewis, two of my favorites. Also has Neal Stephenson's mammoth 1996 article for *Wired* about the Fiberoptic Link Around the Globe [^1]. The single page/print version is [here][wired] if you're not big on hitting 'next page'...*fifty-six times.*

[^1]: Over 42,000 words and worth every one. One of two issues of *Wired* I still own, the other being issue #1.
