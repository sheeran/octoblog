Well, that took a while.  So where the hell have I been the last year?  Lemme see... six months in Las Vegas which was mostly work. Actually it was a lot of work. After the New Year, the lovely wife and I moved to Tucson in warm and sunny Arizona. Alaska it is not.  Six weeks later I was off on a luxurious trip to a couple of countries in the Middle East and Southwest Asia. You have probably heard of them.

Upon returning to the Big U.S of A and after a little procrastinating, I finally decided to buckle down and renovate my humble little shack here on the Internet.  I upgraded to Movable Type 3.11 and rebuilt the entire site from scratch.  I must say, the upgrade to the new version of MT has been worth the time and money. For the past six-months, the near-daily ritual of deleting comment spam had become more fun than I could handle, especially considering the mouth-breathing spammers were posting more to this site than I was. Since the upgrade, I have received the sum total of *one* spam comment. This is certainly due to the fact that I deleted all my old posts, but the new version of Jay Allen's <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/">MT-Blacklist</a> is  a huge improvement.  

As for the site re-design, that was a long process of 'type-save-refresh' in a text editor and numerous browsers.  Everything *seems* to be working fine, but please let me know if something looks screwed up from your neck of the woods. There are still a few things to work on:

1. On the archive page for each individual article, the link offering to sign in to <a href="http://www.typekey.com/">Type Key</a> doesn't appear.  Right now, it doesn't really matter because I've set up the site so anyone can post a comment. We'll see how long that lasts.

2. Work on the banner image at the top of every page. It doesn't get much blander than it is right now.

3. Re-import all of my old entries.

4. Customize the RSS feeds.

Let me know what you think. It's good to be back and I have a lot of catching up to do.

P.S. Gotta give props to <a href="http://www.mcgeheezone.com/blogoSFERICS/">Kevin McGehee</a> for already giving me my link back and stopping by when this place was as dead as a door nail.
