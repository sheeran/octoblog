From ESPN:

>This time, Albert Haynesworth started but had to stop.

>The two-time All-Pro defensive tackle tried to take the Washington Redskins' conditioning test again Monday morning, but he pulled up after three back-and-forth sprints because he felt some irritation in his left knee.

Ummm...I thought that was called _failing_ the test.
