Obama administration using NEA to help move it's message. Besides the obvious impropriety of this, it also seems mighty dumb. I'm willing to bet that folks opposed to Obamacare aren't going to change their mind based on what the NEA or artist community says, paints, sings, performs...or whatever.  

_UPDATE_: NEA Communications Director lies about [his involvement][1] and then gets [fired][2]
