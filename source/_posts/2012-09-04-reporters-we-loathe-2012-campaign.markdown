>Reporters feel like both campaigns have decided to run out the clock with limited press avails, distractions, and negative attacks, rather than run confident campaigns with bold policy platforms or lofty notions of hope and change---leaving the media with little to do but grind along covering the latest shallow, sensational item of the day.

A lot of whining follows for a problem for which they accept no blame themselves. I'm just shocked to hear that candidates don't trust the media.
