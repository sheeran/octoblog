Speaking of Movable Type...a few days ago, Six Apart---the company behind Movable Type---[announced ][1]that they were being bought out by some marketing company called Video Egg. I say Six Apart is "behind Movable Type", but long before this, I wasn't so sure. For the past few years, Six Apart has seemed to focus their efforts regarding individual bloggers towards TypePad and concentrated their *corporate* MT horsepower toward enterprise customers. A quick read of the comments of the above post shows that current TypePad customers aren't too excited about this move. 

It is true that Six Apart released an open-source version of Movable Type ([movabletype.org][2]) some time ago and their [statement][3] today read, in part: 

>"After the recent announcement about Six Apart, some of you might have been wondering about the future of Movable Type. We can be very clear about that: of course we will continue development and support of this platform that now has a decade of history behind it. 

>- Movable Type 4 remains rock-solid blogging software for all uses.
>- Movable Type 5 is a new step up for managing multiple sites.
>- Melody is driven by the most enthusiastic community of bleeding-edge developers."

A quick Google search of "is movable type dead" reveals more than a few results in the affirmative, including in MT's own [forums][4]. I tend to agree. Plug-in development for MT has stagnated. Numerous MT-specific blogs have gone quiet in the last year or more and multiple bloggers have left MT for [WordPress][5]. 

I also find it interesting that MT's statement mentioned [Melody][6], which is another fork of open-source Movable Type that is independent of Six Apart, but includes former SA employees [working][7] on it. 

>"...we believe that by listening to and empowering our community we will unlock the true potential of open source and begin to advance the platform at a more rapid pace."

Their initial release is almost a year late. 

All this---to include an upgrade to MT5 that didn't really add any functionality for me (see previous post also) and having to delete a trainload of spam comments every day---has me thinking of swtiching to WordPress as well. I have a copy of installed on my local machine to mess around with, and so far I'm impressed. The user-interface is much better than MT's, there is an active plug-in and support community and it is much easier to find answers to problems. 

That's not to say that switching is a done deal. Good or bad, I coded this site from scratch and I have a pretty good handle on MT's template and tag system. I'm not too excited about having to port this design (or a new one I'm toying around with) over to a brand new template/theme system. Other issues include ensuring my existing permalinks remain intact (on initial investigation, this is probably not going to be easy) and I've yet to find a good WP plug-in to replicate my 'Elsewhere' sideblog without having to do some major surgery on how each entry is structured.

But who knows. current statements notwithstanding, Movable Type's days may be numbered and I may have to bite the bullet. 

*P.S. Lemme see if I can fit one more cliched metaphor in there.*
