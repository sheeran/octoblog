Random list of things I have been dorking around with. Or, my ever-growing collection of Instapaper articles, starred Reeder items, Tweetbot favs, and Pinboard links that rapidly fills whatever time is available to actually *do something useful*.

- I supported [Chris Coyier's][1] redesign project on Kickstarter and have a lot of excellent web design and development screencasts to catch up on.
- Get smarter on Git
- Ditto for Sass
- Same goes for the Terminal: bash, dotfiles, etc
- Finding nifty packages for Sublime Text 2
- Should I go [all in][2] with [Keyboard Maestro][3]?
- Toying with learning either [Python][4] or [Ruby][5]
- Investigating the new web dev app, [Hammer][6]
- Playing a bit too much Tilt to Live on the iPhone
- I left Things for OmniFocus...is [2Do][8] app next?

What I really need to be doing is figuring out the [Liquid][10] tempting system that [Octopress][9] is built on, so I can change it. But I need some more links for that.
