President Obama gets 57% of the vote in the Democratic primary in West Virginia. Nice work. Except the other guy, the one who got 42%, he's an inmate in a [federal prison][1]...*in Texas*:

>“You know why we have a problem there,” a Democrat said to ABC News. The reporter asked if the Democrat was suggesting many West Virginia voters are racist. Judd is white.  “That’s right,” the Democrat said.

Yep. And since this was a [closed][2] primary in West Virginia, those racist voters are *Democrats*.
