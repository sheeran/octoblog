<p>Apple&#8217;s new sandboxing rules have been creating some headaches for Mac app developers. Many Tricks, the creators of the excellent window management app Moom, are affected by these rules and have posted instructions on how to convert Mac App Store versions of <em>all</em> of their apps to the direct version. For free. </p>
