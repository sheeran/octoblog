These guys made a pretty sweet sling for a camera. I wanted one, but they were out of stock. Now they won't make it anymore because of a patent troll. If I knew who their cowardly "competitor" was, under no circumstances would I purchase anything from them, or from anyone remotely related to them. And then I would kick their dog.
