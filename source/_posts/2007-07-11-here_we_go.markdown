Watch this movie trailer: [01-18-08][1] 

Check out this [website][2]. And then this [one][3]. Apparently they all are related. 

This reminds me of when I stumbled across a hyperlink hidden in a period at the bottom of an Apple.com webpage back in 2003. By the time I found it, the gig was up - something to do with BMW and getting people to go to a certain intersection in NY at a specific time on a certain day. 

It sounds like an interesting way to waste some time, but if this approaches even a fraction of iPhone-level hype, I'm moving to a desert island with no electricity.
