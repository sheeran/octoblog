No, not the insipid political fact checking, the exacting _New Yorker_-kind. An interesting read about a topic that I became somewhat intrigued by in Jay McInerney's _Bright Lights, Big City_.

Bonus content includes a refreshing honest book review:

>Let’s be factual. D’Agata has had every chance imaginable to be taken seriously as an artist. He teaches at Iowa, his books are published by a major house and get reviewed everywhere. His essays are pretty good and could be improved upon, if he took time off from editing anthologies and giving lectures. But he’s a failure of an artist.
