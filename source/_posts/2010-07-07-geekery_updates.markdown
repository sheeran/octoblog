Some gadget thoughts and updates since it has been a while:

First, while I think the Apple iPad is a cool device, I don't really need one. I don't downright scoff it it like I did the iPhone (umm, this crow tastes yummy) and I readily admit that I fiddle with one whenever I went to an Apple store.  

With the impending move overseas and my PowerMac G5 starting to [show it's age][1], what I really wanted to do was downsize (and upgrade) to a new MacBook Pro. Unfortunately, my lovely wife got me an Apple gift card for an iPad for Father's Day. I was able to convince her about my dire "need" for a new laptop and applied the card towards it. 

And now I'm typing on a brand new MacBook Pro with the updated 2.53 GHz Core i5 processor. I love the unibody construction and the hi-resolution matte display is awesome.

Now that I finally have an intel-powered mac, I'll be putting Lightroom 3 and Aperture 3 through their respective paces. Both initially seem like solid upgrades.

Secondly, I upgraded my iPhone 3GS to iOS 4 before I left&#8212;another solid upgrade. As for the iPhone 4, the move overseas pretty much denied that option. When I get back, I'll get an iPhone 6 or something.

And a second or third generation iPad.
