It's 12:30am and I'm sitting in the Seattle airport waiting for a flight to Korea. That will be home for the next two years and preparations for the move (that approach the D-Day invasion in complexity) are the reason things have been quiet around here. I have four hours before my flight leaves and another ten on the plane to write up some things. Stand by to stand by.

_P.S. Happy Fourth of July..._

UPDATE: Made it.
