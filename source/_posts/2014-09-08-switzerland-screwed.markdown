Much bluster and hype surrounding Apple's impending "iWatch." To answer Gruber's question, I say "no." 

I bought my [Rolex][1] fifteen years ago and am wearing it as I type this. What Apple gear from 1999 is anyone today still using on a daily basis? Apple creates some extraordinary products, but I wouldn't use the word 'timeless' to describe many of them.
