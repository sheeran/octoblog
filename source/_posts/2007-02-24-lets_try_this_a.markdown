It was a long time coming, but this site is finally back up and running. Over two years to be somewhat precise. The main reason for the delay was my effort to re-design the site from scratch. The previous design pretty much looked like ass and rather than spend any more time writing for it, I concentrated on re-doing it. 

I started with a blank page back in May of last year. My first idea was scrapped for various reasons after about a month and I started anew with a few goals: simple, easy-to-read layout without a bunch of distracting bells and whistles (one exception being the use of [Lightbox][1] on the [About][2] page---I couldn't resist). I also wanted to add a sideblog called "Elsewhere" for random things I find that don't warrant a full entry. There is also a [Photo Blog][3], but all the credit for its design goes to Doug Bowman of [Stopdesign][4].

*Note: The separate photoblog has since been removed. All my pictures are now on [Flickr][6]*

Over the course of the next six (or eight) months, the process was slow. I would tinker with the design for a few hours a night and then maybe a week would go by without doing anything at all. The long pole in the tent towards the end was creating the templates for [Movable Type][5] and then testing them out. I'm not the smartest web guy by any stretch, so ironing out the kinks took a few days. I'm also no wizard with Photoshop, so the banner image took some time, but I still may work on that a bit. So welcome back, have a look around and feel free to let me know what you think.
