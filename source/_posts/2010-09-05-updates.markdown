Yes, another "excuse" post. In early July, I moved to South Korea. My trooper of a wife was left back back in Vegas (with both kids) to supervise the movers packing up all of our stuff. About two weeks later, they arrived here. About 12 days after that, I left for Alaska for a month. Did I mention how awesome my wife is? I just got back and am enjoying the long weekend. Our stuff gets here on Wednesday and sometime in the near future I have to square away a bunch of paperwork to go pick up our car. Fun times.
