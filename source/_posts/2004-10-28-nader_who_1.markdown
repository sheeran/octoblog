Two of three candidates that ran for president in 2000 are running again in 2004. While Al Gore is busy regaining all the weight he lost for the last contest and giving irritating speeches when he gets bored, George Bush is duking it out with John Kerry.  And every once in a while you <em>might</em> hear something about Ralph Nader.

The only things I have heard about Nader in this election center around his legal battles to get on the ballot in some state or another (he is currently on the ballot in 34 states according to his <a href="http://www.votenader.org/">website</a>) or his single-digit presence in the polls. I haven't seen a single interview with him or news story detailing his positions or analyzing the impact of his candidacy on this close election.  Not one word about his exclusion in the debates, or what he eats for breakfast for that matter.
