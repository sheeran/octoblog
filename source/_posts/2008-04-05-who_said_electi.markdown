Sometimes you can't make this stuff up: Clinton chief strategist tries to play [both sides][1]: 

>Hillary Rodham Clinton's chief strategist, Mark Penn, apologized Friday for "an error in judgment" after meeting with Colombia's ambassador to the United States on Monday, when he reportedly discussed how to push for passage of a bilateral free trade agreement opposed by both Democratic candidates. 

To top it off, Colombia turns around and [fires him][2]: 

>The Colombian government considers this a lack of respect to Colombians, and finds this response unacceptable. 

What's next, Penn sits next to Obama at church? 

**Update:** What's next is Clinton tells Penn to [pound sand][3].
