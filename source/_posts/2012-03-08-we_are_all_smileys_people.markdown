Excellent _New Yorker_ article about the original BBC version of John le Carre's _Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy_ and its sequel, _Smiley's People_, both starring Alex Guinness as George Smiley. Both of these are incredible and faithful six part adaptations and I've probably seen each one at least six times, and read the books twice (including the middle book in the trilogy, _The Honourable Schoolboy_.) Highly recommended, in spite of le Carre being virulently anti-American.
