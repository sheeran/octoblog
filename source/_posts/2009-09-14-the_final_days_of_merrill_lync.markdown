Fascinating inside look on Bank of America's merger with Merrill Lynch.  The meddling of the government, specifically the Treasury Secretary and the Fed is troublesome. Other note of interest: Congress and others in government had a total coronary about AIG's $165 million in bonuses. Merrill paid out $3.6<em>billion</em> on over 15 billion in losses and not a peep.
