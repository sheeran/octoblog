No, just not a lot of interesting stuff going on. And I've been busy...and I also just made the plunge and purchased my first digital SLR camera, a Nikon D40. I'm tired of taking crappy pictures and missing things waiting for the old Canon S410 to spool up. The little tooter-head does not wait for such things.
