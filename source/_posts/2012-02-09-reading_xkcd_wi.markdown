If, like me, you are a fan of the web comic [*xkcd*][xkcd], then surely you are aware that part of the fun of each comic is the pithy text contained in the title attribute of each graphic. A DFW-style footnote for each comic, if you will. The problem when viewing these in a browser is the tooltip that appears when mousing over the image goes away after a few seconds. And sometimes these 'footnotes' are a little lengthy.

Lucky for me I rarely read _xkcd_ with a browser.  I use [Reeder][reederapp], both on the Mac and on my iPhone. And the iOS version of Reeder seems to have a feature that was built just for this. If you pinch-to-zoom on the image in Reeder, it expands to fill the screen. Touch the image and you get the title attribute displayed along with an option to save it locally.

*That* is attention to detail.
