Marco Arment:

>I hate that Josh and Nilay took my offhand comment about Engadget and PR relationships so severely and personally. I hate that these two people, who I’ve met and have gotten along with quite well, now think that I’m a complete asshole because they inferred something far more severe than what I really meant.

I have no dog in this _are-tech-bloggers-in-the-tank-for-tech-manufacturers_ fight. He may even be right. However, I find it strange that Marco fails to see how calling the integrity of a writer [into question][1]---flippantly or not---would result in said writer not taking too kindly to that kind of accusation.
