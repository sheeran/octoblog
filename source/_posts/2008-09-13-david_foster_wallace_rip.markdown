How sad. DFW was one of my favorite non-fiction writers, footnotes and all. I wasn't a huge fan of his fiction and I never tackled <em>Infinite Jest</em>, but I was blown away when I read his 1996 tennis essay in Esquire. Ever since then his articles on topics ranging from cruise ships, talk radio and usage dictionaries (another fav) have been excellent. How depressing there won't be anymore of them.
