I installed the [Collusion][mozilla] plug-in for Firefix that graphically depicts all the third party sites that track you as you browse the web. I then visited the following sites: [Drudge Report][drudgereport], [The Daily Caller][dailycaller], [ESPN][espn], [Politico][politico] and [Macworld][macworld]---5 sites in my "Daily Reads" folder that I visit...umm, pretty much daily. And this is what collusion showed after about two minutes:

<img src="/images/collusion.jpg" width="445" height="385" alt="map of visited and unvisited sites" />

*Five* of those circles are the result of me selecting a site to visit. The rest are not. Frightening.
