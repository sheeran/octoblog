Back in October, I linked to a an [article][theatlantic] in the *Atlantic* about how corrupt the NCAA is. While browsing around, I happened to find that Branch has written an expanded version at [Byliner][byliner], called *The Cartel*. An immediate download to iPad.

Along those same lines---the NCAA is an utterly corrupt organization that needs to be crushed---I stumbled upon Joe Nocera's [blog][nytimes] at the *New York Times* where he writes about this topic often.

I'm starting to feel a bit guilty about all those games I went to back in college.
