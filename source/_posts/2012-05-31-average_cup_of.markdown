Marco Ament [today][1]:

>People always ask me how they can make great coffee.

I am not one of them. Coffee is noting more than a caffeine delivery device. I use a Keureg, which I'm sure is sacrilege to guys like Ament and [Shawn Blanc][2]. And I don't care because it is quick, efficient and tastes fine to me.
