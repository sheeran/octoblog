Whirrrrrr, click. Does this thing still work? Coming up on a year since my last post, hopefully I remember all the geekery involved in making a simple text file get published here.

One big reason for the absence was last summer I learned about [Steam][1], and their famous Summer Sales. I have dabbled with video games off and on over the years -- Age of Empires and other RTS games. It was a discounted copy of Civilization V that I got in some Mac software bundle that actually introduced me to Steam.

So I was browsing around looking for other games that were Mac compatible and would run on my then-three-year old Mac Book Pro. And I stumbled upon [_Borderlands 2_][2].

Turn out the lights, see you later. What an amazing video game. Terrific story, addictive and just fun to play. Huge game world with tons of stuff to do. It&#8217;s marketed as a co-op shooter, but I have played it for over 500 hours solo. 

I have other reasons why I have lets this site go dormant for nearly a year, but _Borderlands 2_ is by far the best one.
