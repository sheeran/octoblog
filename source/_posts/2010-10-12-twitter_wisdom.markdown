One of the best [tweets][twitter] I have ever seen, today by [John Podhoretz][twitter 2]:

>People who retweet items in praise of themselves...shouldn't. 

And the [Gruber][twitter 3] corollary to this---being a borderline asshole (usually about the Yankees) and then retweeting when people bitch about it---doesn't work either.
