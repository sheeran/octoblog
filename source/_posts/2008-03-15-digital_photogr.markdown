Although I don't look forward to doing anything about it (see below), one area of this site that needs some tweaking is the photos section. Currently, the photos page is a separate blog with <a href="http://stopdesign.com/templates/photos/">templates</a> created by Doug Bowman of <a href="http://stopdesign.com/">StopDesign</a>. What I liked about these templates is I could upload pictures from within iPhoto, but as I have gotten more involved in digital photography, I don't use iPhoto anymore - I've moved up to Adobe Photoshop Lightroom. And exporting from Lightroom to iPhoto just to export again to my website doesn't make a lot of sense.

I have had a Flickr account for a while, but haven't really used it for anything. While looking around for other alternatives to my current setup, I have narrowed my options down to the following:

  * [Flickr][1]
  * [SmugMug][2] - which I learned about from a WSJ article
  * [zenfolio][3] - from poking around the DP Review Forums

All of three of these are hosted solutions - meaning the pictures don't live on my server anymore, and I don't really have a problem with that. Let someone else do the heavy lifting. There are existing Lightroom export/upload utilities for each of these as well - another bonus.

If you have any experience with any of these, please fire away. I'll let you know what I finally decide.

As an aside, I have been playing around with the Aperture 2.0 trial, but more on that later.
