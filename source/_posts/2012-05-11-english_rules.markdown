Joan Acocella's _New Yorker_ [article][1] about the "the English Wars" and the ongoing battles between the prescriptivists---those that think there are rules for written and spoken English---and descriptivists, who disagree and just document "what the current practice" is,[^1] is a great read, although I didn't get past the first paragraph without thinking of David Foster Wallace's wonderful 2001 [piece][2] for _Harper's_ about pretty much the same subject. 

Being a conservative, I obviously fall into the prescriptivist camp as a matter of principle, but certainly don't as a matter of practice. Plus, it's good to be on the same as DFW,[^2] if only in terms of the former. I'm sure his grocery list employed better grammar than anything I've written.

I did find it kind of ironic to read about the various arguments between the two camps, especially those regarding the charges of elitism directed towards the prescriptivists, in a magazine that [still insists][3] on putting a diaeresis in words such as 'pre&#235;mptive', 'na&#239;ve', and 'co&#246;perate.'


[^1]: I think it's safe to say the New Yorker is firmly on the prescriptivist side.
