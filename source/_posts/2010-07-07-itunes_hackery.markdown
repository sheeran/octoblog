Last year I [posted][1] about how my iTunes Store account was hacked. Cliff note version: somebody got ahold of my iTunes account password and purchased some of their own bogus $10 apps from the iTunes store. I called Apple and they refunded me the charges and shortly thereafter, the apps in question were removed from the app store.

Well, it appears the same trick was being [used again][2] and on a much larger scale. This has even made the front page of Drudge and Apple PR has kicked in. So how is it these bogus apps are getting approved in the first place?
