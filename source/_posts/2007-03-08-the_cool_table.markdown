If I could only read one blog a day, it would be John Gruber's [Daring Fireball][1]. It's _the_ place for all things related to The Company Formerly Known As[ Apple Computer][2]. But today he posted an [entry][3] that follows an irregular-but-no-less annoying pattern, which can be summarized as such:

>_I'm a member of a club that is too cool for school and we just initiated some new members._ [Deeply buried subtext: _You are not one of them._] 

What is this "cool club" and who is in it? This club is called [The Deck][4] and its members are various web design-related sites that have one other common feature: they sell ads. 

Let me start by saying that I have no problems with websites that advertise. Having a house on Internet street costs money and somebody has to pay the rent. For some web authors, ad revenue is a significant portion of their income. And from a reader perspective, these ads are way down on the annoying scale: they are small, unobtrusive and there is only one per page. I'm a regular reader of more than a few of the websites involved and I have even clicked on a few of these ads. 

I also understand--and appreciate--why they are selective in which ads they will accept. What I don't get is why these otherwise excellent sites feel the need to act like some sort of exclusive college fraternity and [announce][5] when new [members][6] have been admitted to the frat house. This leads to responses such as [this][7] from one of the new pledges: 

>"I feel honored having been invited to join The Deck, a premier advertising network for creative, web and design professionals." 

This is like the Sundance Channel and the Independent Film Channel airing a commercial that they have invited Bravo to air the same ads. Who cares? Again, I enjoy reading these sites and I don't begrudge them for displaying ads, especially these. But these sites are good for a myriad of reasons: strong writing, and excellent design to name two, but being in the same advertising club isn't one of them. I hope they make a pile of cash and take a trip to the Bahamas as long as they keep doing what they are doing when they get back. But spare me the updates on who made this year's cheerleading squad. 

_Note:_  I've had this filed away for when I got around to writing this post: [The Dreck][8].
