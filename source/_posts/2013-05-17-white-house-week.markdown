Heckuva week for the White House. I'm sure the document dump in a few hours will be awesome. A few good reads:

Kimberley Strassel in the *WSJ*: [The IRS Scandal Started at the Top][wsj]. Of course it did. 

Stephen Hayes in the *Weekly Standard*: [What About the Video?][ws] Yeah, that stupid YouTube video that was, according to the administration, the source of the Benghazi attack. 

I feel like I'm forgetting something....right, the Department of Justice digging into AP phone records. I would expect press coverage of the other two to be a bit less conciliatory to the White House now.
