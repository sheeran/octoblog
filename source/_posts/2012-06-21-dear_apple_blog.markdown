Please stop circle jerking my RSS feed. Do you really think I subscribe to your site, but *not* John Gruber&#8217;s [Daring Fireball][1]? Save your pointless Linked List (how ironic) post, sans editorial. And "Gruber nails it" doesn't count. "Gruber is wrong" is only marginally better, but you have to explain why.

I can't wait to see how many links show up for John Siracusa&#8217;s upcoming epic Mountain Lion review. Most of which will probably be posted after Gruber does it.
