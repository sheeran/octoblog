I have 27 of these installed. I use about 5 every day (Total Finder, Alfred, Reeder, Twitterific, 1Password) and a few more that don't get used much at all: Divvy and Moom are two window management apps that Total Finder has pretty much made unnecessary. And Byword should definitely be on this list.
