...about what happens to the actual Olympic medals that get taken away from an athlete, for whatever reason. Interesting side note: while I had a vague idea of the controversy involving the US men's basketball team losing the gold medal in 1972, I did not know that to this day the US has refused to accept the silver medal and the medals remain in a vault in Switzerland.
