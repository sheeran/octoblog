[Ben Brooks][1] had a link to Thomas Brand's [post][2] about buying a Bond Watch:

>With the exception of my computers, I own very little in the line of luxury. I do not own a car, my TV has always been small, my home is just an apartment on a busy street. I bought my Bond Watch because it is the best I could afford, and hope it lasts long.

One of my most treasured possessions is a [Rolex][3] GMT Master II ([16710][4]). I purchased it brand new in 1998, and have worn it nearly non-stop since [^1].  It has literally been around the world a few times and while the bracelet shows its years, the crystal is still flawless. I could barely afford it then, when I was young and single, and most certainly couldn't today---it would cost nearly three times what I paid fourteen years ago.

Of all the things I own, this watch is the one object that makes me smile knowing that one day it will belong to my son.



[^1]: When I'm not, it's a Swiss Army [Maverick II][5], a Christmas gift from the lovely wife, or I'm running and it's a Timex something or another.
