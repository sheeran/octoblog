I have written here before, in a blog post long since gone, about my utter disdain for Rage Against the Machine. Aside from the fact that their music pretty much sucks, my main beef is that they are a bunch of poseurs. I'll buy their tired, 'workers of the world unite' leftist tripe when they start giving their albums away. I do give them props for following the "party" line, base on recent [comments][1] by lead singer Zack de la Rocha: 

> He also railed against the war in Iraq and likened Bush administration officials to Nazi war criminals - "This current administration is no exception. They should be tried and hung and shot," he said.

How quaint.
