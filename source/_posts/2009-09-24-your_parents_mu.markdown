What a bunch of f@#$ing cowards. From the [article](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6848176.ece):

>Anti-G20 protesters rampaged through the city centre of Pittsburgh tonight, smashing up shops and throwing rocks at police, as officers used tear gas and baton-charges in an attempt to bring them under control. 

>In riots which continued through the middle of the evening rush hour, about 300 protesters were reported to have remained from an initial crowd of 2,000 in Bloomfield, Pittsburgh's Little Italy. 

>Frustrated in their attempts to reach the venue where world leaders are meeting, the crowd, many of whom wore face-masks and armed themselves with rocks, broke windows at fast-food restaurants, a BMW dealership and a bank in the area, about a mile from the fenced-off convention centre.

If you anonymous mouthbreathing dipshits think it is so important to protest a meeting that will result in nothing anyway, then sack up and let the world know who you are. I guess you're afraid Mommy and Daddy may cut off your allowance and then you'd be stuck at home contributing nothing to society rather than rampaging around and subtracting from it.
