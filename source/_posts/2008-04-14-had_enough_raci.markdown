As I tried mightily to slog through [this diatribe][1] about how wickedly misogynistic Hillary is being treated, I stopped immediately upon reading this: 

>"I pinpoint sexism for a living. You'd think I'd be able to find an example. And I hate to rely on this hokey notion that there's some woman's way of knowing, and that I just fucking know. But I do. I just know." 

Well, well. _Of course_ you just know. That's what you do for a living. If you couldn't find it, you wouldn't eat. See also: self-licking ice cream cone. 

Another gem: 

>"The whole 'Hillary Clinton is a monster' theme is so virulent." 

Really? Like a virus? No chance whatsoever that her complete lack of integrity has anything to do with it? Or this: 

>"They're busy patting themselves on the back for supporting a black man: Aren't we cool?" 

Remember, and file this away because it will come up again if Hillary "wins" the nomination: They are talking about _Democrats_ here. Original link via [Instapundit][2].
