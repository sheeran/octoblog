Octopress is the "blogging framework for hackers", and while I'm certainly no hacker, I do enjoy learning about how it works and bending it ever-so-slightly to my will. Here is a list of resources that I have found useful for using this excellent platform.

- Obviously, the [official documentation][docs] is a good place to start
- Developer Brandon Mathis has always been responsive via the [@octopress][twitter] twitter account
- The "official" support channel is a mailing list on [Google Groups][gg]. I get summaries emailed to me weekly
- Many fine folks have saved Octopress links to [Pinboard][pb]. My specific links are [here][mypb]
- If you run into issues, maybe someone else has. Check out the Octopress tag at [Stack Overflow.][so] You can subscribe to these via email as well.

I also use to follow the Issues tab of the Octopress GitHub [repository][gh]. Brandon has since closed it so he can focus on the next release, which for months has been "2.1", but will actually be a "3.0". I'm excited to see what is in store.
