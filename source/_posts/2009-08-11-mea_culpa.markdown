In the past, I have [scoffed][1] Facebook and been proven [correct][2]. And I have [railed][3] against iPhone hype...and been wrong. 

I finally broke down and joined the rest of the lemmings and picked up an iPhone 3G S, on launch day no less. I was sort of intrigued by the whole thing and took a closer look when I knew a new phone itself was coming out, as well the updated 3.0 software. I also qualified for the subsidized $199 price for a 16 GB model.

After almost two months, I have to admit the iPhone is one of the coolest things ever. It really is a revolutionary device, and I rarely ever actually use it as a&#8212;you know&#8212;_phone_. Here is a quick, stream-of-consciousness review:

### The Awesome

+ Mobile Safari - I was not expecting a web browser this capable. I have surfed the web for hours on the couch with this thing. The ability to manipulate the page with gestures is genius.

+ Visual Voicemail - David Pogue and I are on the same sheet [here][4]. Not having to listen to that stupid voicemail menu makes my day.

+ Google Maps + Compass. - I use this all the time. 

+ Mail - syncs perfectly with my Gmail account and Mail.app on my PowerMac, thanks to this [article][5]. I have also been playing with the iPhone-enabled GMail page from Mobile Safari as a page on the homescreen&#8212;well done and in some cases better than Mail (the same Google web item also has links to iPhone-optimized Google Calendar and Reader pages...very well done).

+ WiFi - excellent, as well as the ability to remember networks and auto-connect to them.

### The Good

+ The onscreen keyboard is easier to use than I thought, but still takes some getting used to. One thing I miss from my Blackberry is the ability to hold down a letter to get it as a capital. 

+ Photos - I don't take a lot of pictures with it, but I've synched a fair amount from my desktop.

+ The App Store - This is like crack cocaine (I'm guessing). I've bought lots of useless stuff. And I can't stop.

### The Whatever

+ Voice Control - doesn't work so hot when I need it to - like driving.

+ Voice Memos - relegated to my last homepage screen along with YouTube and iTunes.

+ Messages - There are legions of ten-year-olds that send more text messages during the walk to social studies then I have in my entire life. 

So I stand corrected. The iPhone rules. Standby for a future post about iPhone Apps I use (or don't).
