I have to admit, [Newsweek's][1] _very_ in-depth look inside the Bush and Kerry campaigns has been an excellent read. Set aside an hour or two and check it out. Interesting things I've learned: 

1.  John Kerry curses like a sailor.
2.  Teresa Heinz Kerry is a complete weirdo.
3.  Actually, after reading this, I'm convinced that Teresa would have probably done more damage to this country than her husband.
4.  The Kerry campaign had _way_ too many chiefs.
5.  We have a winner in the Best Bush Nickname Contest: "Turd Blossom" - for none other than Karl Rove. That is funny.
