I came across [Brett Terpstra's][terpstra] cool bit of code to keep local copies of your Pinboard links. Like Brett, I use [Delibar][delibar] to send links to [Pinboard][pb], and via [his script][gh], they automatically get saved to my machine. And also like, Brett, I use the [Tags app][tags] to tag all sorts of things on my Mac. 

When I first ran the script, all of my Pinboard tags then appeared in my Tags browser. And every time I add a new one, it gets saved locally. No chron job required if you are a smart man and use [Hazel][hazel]. Which I do...like Brett.

Yes, I like Brett Terpstra. You should read ([and buy][marked]) his stuff if you're a Mac user. And then you'll like him too.
