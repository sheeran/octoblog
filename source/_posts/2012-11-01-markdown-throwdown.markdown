John Gruber's [Markdown][6] writing syntax has exploded in popularity recently, although Gruber hasn't done much with it for many years. Other developers have expanded on its original capabilities, to include Fletcher Penny's [MultiMarkdown][5].

Jeff Atwood [would like an official Markdown standard][1] to unify the disparate implementations and parsers and fix some outstanding bugs. He would like Gruber's buy-in to his plan, but he [may not have handled that so well][2]. And Gruber doesn't seem all that interested in participating. Color me surprised.

Macdrifter thinks the [answer][4] already exists with MultiMarkdown.

The comments in [this Hacker News thread][3] are instructive as well.

I'm curious to see where this goes.
