Mark Steyn, in [National Review Online][1] on Chuck Hagel's trainwreck of confirmation hearing this week:

> So five minutes later the handlers discreetly swung into action to “contain” Hagel. “I was just handed a note that I misspoke,” he announced, “that I said I supported the president’s position on containment. If I said that, I meant to say that we don’t have a position on containment.” Hagel’s revised position is that there is no position on containment for him to have a position on.

If I were a Department of Defense employee, I would be a tad worried. Don't think so? Well, there's this:

> “There are a lot of things I don’t know about,” said Hagel. “If confirmed, I intend to know a lot more than I do.”

> He then denied that “I will be running anything.” Don’t let the fact that the secretary of defense presides over 40 percent of the entire planet’s military spending confuse you. He’s not really “running” a thing — or, as he was anxious to assure us, “I won’t be in a policy-making position.”

Yikes.
