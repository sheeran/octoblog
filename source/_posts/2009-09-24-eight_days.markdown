The article is not available online unless you're a _New Yorker_ subscriber, so find a way to get ahold of the Sep 21 issue and read James Stewart's outstanding article about the crucial week last year at the heart of Wall Street meltdown. I wonder if we'll hear anymore about this quote from then-Treasury Secretary Paulson about GWB: 

> "People don't want to hear this. They don't like him. They want to see him as disengaged. But he was very focused on what was best for the country."
