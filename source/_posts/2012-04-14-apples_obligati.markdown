Stephen Hackett of [512 Pixels][512pixels] quoted [this bit][cnn] from Clyde Prestowitz's article at CNN about "Apple's obligation to help solve America's problems:"

>As a business, Apple has a right to fear that moving the assembly work from China to the United States will entail raising labor costs so high as to make the company less competitive and profitable. But for it to say that it has no obligation to help solve America’s problems is completely unacceptable.

And Hackett's reply was: "*I really don’t know what to think about this article.*"

I know exactly what to think. Complete garbage.
