Jason Santa Maria talking about his new project, [Editorially][1], yesterday: 

{% blockquote @jasonsantamaria https://twitter.com/jasonsantamaria/status/300967815706447873 %}
For today we ship.
{% endblockquote %}

"Coming soon. Sign up to get invited." That's not quite shipping. 

Contrast with Macdrifter's and Erik Hess' new project, [CriticMarkup][2]--a tool by coincidence not completely unrelated to Editorially. Announced with no pre-hype, and available on multiple platforms.

Editorially maybe the coolest thing for writing since the typewriter. But I'll reserve judgment until it actually, you know, *ships*.
