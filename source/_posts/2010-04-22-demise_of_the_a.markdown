I hope this [theory][arstechnica] by arstechnica turns out not to be true:

> For the last several years, Apple has maintained a comprehensive (if not exhaustive) list of available Mac OS X software on its website. This has been a great resource for those who aren't familiar with sites like MacUpdate or Version Tracker. However, the page hasn't been updated since March 26---almost a month---leaving many developers to wonder if Apple may soon discontinue the service in order to shift its focus to a more locked-down distribution model for the Mac.

I've had a [bookmark][apple] for that site since I don't know when and found some neat stuff there. Hopefully it doesn't go away, and double-hopeful it doesn't go away for the reason noted.
