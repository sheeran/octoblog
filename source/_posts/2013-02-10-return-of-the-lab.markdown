Well, not really a return. It has always been there, but I have finally got around to putting back a link to it after the Octopress changeover.

The [Lab][1] is my HTML/CSS playground. When I'm messing around with some web-related thingy, I build a page for it in the Lab. Maintaining a vertical rhythm with type, responsive layouts, shiny CSS3 stuff, whatever. The big project currently is a planned [re-design][2] for this site. I have been working on it off and on for the past eighteen months. The big remaining hurdle is to convert the templates over to my Octopress installation.
