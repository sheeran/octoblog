I'm off to Owego, NY early in the AM for work. Need to coordinate all crappy weather to be somewhere other than O'Hare and Syracuse. I'll be back on Friday. Here are some utterly random thoughts:

I'm kind of beaked that Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3 is going to be Intel-only

Message to all iPhone game developers that implement the stupid option to send my score to Facebook and/or Twitter: Stop it...that's lame.

I'm a Dodgers fan, but I really detest the Yankees..._Go Philly_!

I'll be the first to scoff the MSM for being in the tank for the Obama White House, so let me also say kudos for taking a stand against the administration's silly cat fight against Fox News.

Who is the marketing genius that came up with the final tag line for those (completely annoying) Most Interesting Man Dos Equis commercials? _"I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis."_ Could he have qualified his support even more? Is the Most Interesting Man supposed to be Bill Clinton?

My carbon footprint is probably one tenth that of Al Gore's. Therefore, I feel I am exempt from his nannying lectures.

Having lived in Las Vegas for the last 3+ years, trust me when I say that the Senator Harry Reid that the nation sees and the Senator Reid that is presented to the Nevada public in the form of campaign ads are two different people.

Did you ever notice that nametags worn by the Delta Force commandos masquerading as TSA employees are their first names? Police officers, military members, other professional fields: last names. That guy that sold you a Big Mac yesterday...first name. How fitting.
