One of my quirkier traits is a disproportionate interest in the America's Cup sailing race in relation to the amount of time I have spent on a sailboat, which is zero. My interest over the years has waned as many of the battles have been fought in the courtroom as on the water. I found this article interesting, but I don't see Ellison being the savior of the oldest contested trophy in international sports.
