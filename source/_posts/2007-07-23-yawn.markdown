Recent events have caused me to modify my ongoing list of things I really don't care about. Here is the current Top 5: 

  1. Actually, anything remotely related to the iPhone
  2. Hacking the iPhone
  3. David Beckham (although if you add his wife, he bumps up a spot)
  4. Anything relating to any Presidential candidate before 2008
  5. iPhone 2.0 Wishlists - _it is only a matter of time, might as well start early_
