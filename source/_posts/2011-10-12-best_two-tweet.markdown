Ezra Klein, the _Washington Post_ wonderkid who thinks the Constitution is hard to read and stuff had this snarky, gotcha question for the Republican debate tonight on [twitter][1]:

> Question for #Econdebate: "If we had the prime minister of Slovakia on the phone right now, what would you tell him? You first, Mr. Cain."

Ahh, the classic stump-the-Republican-dummy question. Not really relevant for an "econdebate", but no matter. Klein then completely wins the internet for the week with a very quick [follow-up][2]:

> Correcting last tweet: PM of Slovakia is a her.

Absolutely priceless.
