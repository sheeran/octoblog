While trying to make some progress whittling down my Instapaper queue, here's two recent articles on one of the more fascinating topics (to me at least) in a long while: the ingenious Stuxnet worm and how it was used to degrade Iran's nuclear capability.

Wired: [Stuxnet Missing Link Found, Resolves Some Mysteries Around the Cyberweapon][wired]  
IEEE Spectrum: [The Real Story of Stuxnet][ieee]

And two older articles:

The NY Times (June 2012): [Obama Order Sped Up Wave of Cyberattacks Against Iran][nytimes]  
Vanity Fair (April 2011): [A Declaration of Cyber-War][vf]
