Sarah Pavis, on [Kottke][1]:

> A popular option for moving companies to offer in Japan is, not only to transport your belongings, but to pack them and unpack them for you.

Seriously? I have moved twenty times and every single time, they pack and unpack my stuff. BFD. Now, packers here in America are hardly as dedicated as those in Japan (see the video), but I did move to Korea (and back) twice. Those dudes are efficient as hell and they can cut cardboard into any shape to wrap anything. Including my couch.
