I just ordered David Mamet's [new book][1], *The Secret Knowledge: On the Dismantling of American Culture*, about his path to conservatism. The Left can have all the Alec Baldwin's, Sean Penn's and Susan Sarandon's they want. None of them can carry Mamet's pencil. 

Here is Mamet's seminal Village Voice [article][2] from two years ago, *"Why I Am No Longer Brain-Dead Liberal."* 

And here is Andrew Ferguson's [excellent writeup][3] in the *Weekly Standard.* 

*Update:* Here is a John Podhertz [column][4] about Mamet. The story at the end is priceless. 

*Update 2:* And here is a long [transcript][5] of Mamet's interview on the Hugh Hewitt show.
