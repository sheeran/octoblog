A survey of Yale students shows that a [majority of students][yaledailynews] support the return of ROTC to campus.

Not so fast. Colman McCarthy writes in the [Washington Post][washingtonpost]:

>"It should not be forgotten that schools have legitimate and moral reasons for keeping the military at bay, regardless of the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell." They can stand with those who for reasons of conscience reject military solutions to conflicts."

And...

>"Their pride in running programs in women's studies, black studies, and gay and lesbian studies is well-founded, but schools have small claims to greatness so long as the study of peace is not equal to the other departments when it comes to size and funding."

It gets better:

>"I admire those who join armies, whether America's or the Taliban's: for their discipline, for their loyalty to their buddies and to their principles, for their sacrifices to be away from home."

Nothing like a good dose of moral equivalence to get your point across. More goodness:

>"ROTC and its warrior ethic taint the intellectual purity of a school, if by purity we mean trying to rise above the foul idea that nations can kill and destroy their way to peace."

Oh, I see. *Intellectual purity* is the goal of higher education. Explains the rigid adherence to liberal dogma. I have two reactions to the foul hate speech of peacenik cretins such as Mr. McCarthy. One is to refer them to the John Stuart Mill quote on my [About][nealsheeran] page.

The other is to punch them in the face.

*UPDATE*: [Jonah Goldberg][nationalreview] is all over it. As is [Moe Lane][redstate].

*More Updates*: [Stephen Green][pajamasmedia] and [Victor David Hanson][nationalreview 2], who has this gem:

>"Examine questions of free speech, intellectual diversity, and  tolerance for minority opinion on an average campus, and the notion of &#8220;intellectual purity&#8221; is rendered Orwellian."
