My current machine is an Apple PowerMac Dual 2.0 G5 which I've had since February 2006. I've added an additional hard drive and bumped up the RAM (twice). It's a perfectly fine machine. Does what I need it to. However, it's not an Intel machine and can't run Snow Leopard (10.6). And the ramifications of that are starting to show. Here's a current list of apps I've been an interested in the last few months that require either an Intel processor and/or Mac OS 10.6:

1. [Acorn 2][1] 
2. [Aperture 3][2] 
3. [Adobe Lightroom 3 Beta][3] 
4. [MarsEdit 3][4] It may be time for a new MacBook Pro... 

*Update:* And [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome)
