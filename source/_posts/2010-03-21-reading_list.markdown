Last book read: _The Given Day_ by Dennis Lehane. Very good. 

Books on the way: 
+ _The Big Short_, Michael Lewis. If it was "The Big Phone Book" by Michael Lewis, it would still be on the way. 
+ _Shibumi_, Trevanian. Meant to read this a long time ago. 
+ _Fly Fishing with Darth Vader: And Other Adventures with Evangelical Wrestlers, Political Hitmen, and Jewish Cowboys_, Matt Labash 

Books here and waiting, some longer than others: 
+ _Empire of the Sun_, J.G. Ballard. One of my favorite films of all time. 
+ _The Pillars of the Earth_, Ken Follett 
+ _Cobra II_, Michael Gordon and Bernard Trainor 
+ _The Housing Boom and Bust_, Thomas Sowell 
+ _The Civil War, Vol III: Red River to Appomattox_, Shelby Foote 
+ _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_, William Shirer
