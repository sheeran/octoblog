Truly *outstanding* article about Jeffrey MacDonald, the Green Beret doctor who killed his family in 1970.  Props to the author, Gene Weingarten, for making his stance on the MaDonald's guilt or innocence very clear. Filmmaker Errol Morris loses points in my book for thinking he is innocent. 

>I have come to believe that Jeffrey MacDonald murdered his family and injured himself as part of a coverup; Iâ€™ve concluded this both because I have researched the case extensively, and because, as a writer, I see exactly how Errol Morris prejudiced his account while shrewdly appearing not to do so. I admire his skill but not his book. I think the media have been careless and gullible in reviewing it, perhaps partially because the story of a grievous, enduring miscarriage of justice presents a more compelling narrative than the alternative.
