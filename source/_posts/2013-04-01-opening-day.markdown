Pretty great opening day for Clayton Kershaw. Wanna know why baseball is better than the NFL and their stupid halftime shows and silly gimmicks? Here's why: 

> Dodgers co-owner Magic Johnson was the mound before the game when manager Don Mattingly came out and signaled for a reliever. In came Koufax to throw the first ball to former Dodgers ace Orel Hershiser.

>A few minutes later, the crowd looked toward Vin Scully's booth, where he began his 64th season, and the revered broadcaster pronounced: "It's time for Dodger baseball."
