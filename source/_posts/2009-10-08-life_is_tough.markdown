It's tougher when you're stupid. And it's *really* tough when you whine about it like a little girl. St. Louis Cardinal pitcher Adam Wainwright [talking](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=291008119) about Matt Holiday's error in the bottom of the ninth inning with two outs and one run lead that allowed the Dodgers to score two runs, win the game and go up 2-0 in the NLDS.

>That ball got lost in 50,000 white towels shaking in front of Matt's face," Wainwright said. "It doesn't really seem fair that an opposing team should be able to allow their fans to shake white towels when there's a white baseball flying through the air. How about Dodger Blue towels?"

You're complaining about the fans? Who are waving little towels? It's not *fair*? How about a nice cup of suck it? Wainwright -- you pitched a nice game, it was a tough loss, but sack up and quit being a crybaby. 

P.S. *Go Dodgers!*
