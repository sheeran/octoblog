Jason Kottke, regarding Obama's drone war:

> Dangerous dangerous precedent here. If George W. Bush were doing this sort of thing, we'd be marching in the streets about it. Why does Obama get a free pass? 

Very good question, Jason. Let me know when you get an answer.

> Anyone in the press want to ask the President about the legality & moral stickiness of drone strikes at his next press conference?

Oh, the stunning naivet√© in that statement.
