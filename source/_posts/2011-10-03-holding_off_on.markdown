I downloaded Mac OS X Lion the day it was released, but held off on installing it since I was traveling and far from my backup disk (yes, not smart, but also not the point). I've never been one to install a new OS on day one anyway. I usually wait a few days/weeks to see if there are any major issues. Let the fanboys be the lab rats, I say.

Well, it paid off when I came across [this post][1] at _Ars Technica_ about many users of 2010 MacBook Pros having major video issues and "black screens of death." The article points to [this thread][2] on the Apple Support forums, that as of this writing is a whopping 104 pages, all filled with posts by very frustrated users complaining about the issue. Most people had little to no problems under Snow Leopard and now the only explanation/recourse path given by Apple is to swap out the logic board.

I have a 2010 MacBook Pro and it is the best computer I've ever had.[^1] I haven't had a single problem with it under Snow Leopard and there is nothing new in Lion that makes want to get anywhere near this issue. 

One thing I did learn was that the Mac App Store did update my Lion installer to 10.7.1 when it was released. We'll see if a future update addresses this. 

*Update (25 Oct):* Apple acknowledged the issue with an article [here][3]. And according to [CNET][4], they have issued a software update for Lion users. Unfortunately, Apple's KB article says that if this doesn't work, users need to get in touch with Apple support for a diagnostic test. A problematic course of action for me since I live overseas. The original [forums post][5] is up to 129 pages now, with results for this patch being mixed. Still holding off for now.
