Browsing through my Longform iPad app, I came across this snarkfest between the *[Harpers][providencejournal]* and *[Atlantic][theatlantic]*. Some interesting points...I'm pretty much on the *Atlantic*'s side of this (silly) argument---whether online content is good or bad---but what I found slightly more interesting is when I clicked to the Atlantic page to read the byline and noticed that the author, one Alexis Madrigal, wrote a book called *"Powering the Dream: The History and Promise of Green Technology."*

Yeah...how is that "dream" and "promise" working out so far? Oh, wait, I think another green tech firm just went bankrupt.
