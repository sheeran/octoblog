News Corps is [going to sell][1] MySpace to Specific Media for $35 million, which is about $545 million less than they paid for it six years ago. 

*Cliff Notes Version, Not Without Biased Commentary*: A shitty social website that is exponentially lamer now then when it started is going to "revitalize and transform" itself, care of an online ad company and…wait for it…*Justin Timberlake*. I'm not making this up: 

>Timberlake will have an office at MySpace's Beverly Hills headquarters and a staff of about a half dozen people working for him "around the clock" developing his ideas for the site, said Specific Media CEO Tim Vanderhook. 

I can't wait. The interesting part is at the end: 

>At $35 million, Specific Media gets an Internet property for a price that Altimeter's Li called "ridiculously low" and values each monthly U.S. visitor at about $1 each. Its new owners should be able to recoup their investment if the company gets each user to click on about 20 ads over their lifetime, she said. 

Nothing earth-shattering about making money off of ads, but if getting ad clicks is really what it is all about, I wouldn't have a lot of faith in the *"revitalize and transform"* part. And using anyone's *lifetime* has a measure of ROI, especially for something like a social media site, is probably not very wise. 

I'll go out on a limb and predict that MySpace will continue to suck.
