I couldn't take it anymore. Everywhere I look, it's there. Everyone is doing it. I can't swing a dead cat without hearing about it. Was I missing out on the next big thing because it was only being talked about _over there_?

_Twitter_ 

Yes, I [scoffed][1] it before (something about a blowtorch). Whatever. I figured I would give it a shot and see. So feel free to make fun of me on Twitter: [@nealsheeran][2].

Your friendly neighborhood lemming.
